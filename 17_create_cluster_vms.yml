# This Playbook creates the Helper VM and all Kubernetes Master and Worker VM infrastructure
#
# ASSUMPTIONS:
# The host should have access to the Internet for the download of cloud images OR
# The necessary cloud image is available in a local folder name cloud_images from where this playbook is running
# Will make use of sudo password in the configs/password.yml in clear text
# Overriding of variables in role/defaults is in configs/cloudinit-config.yml. 
# VMs created using cloud-init require a DHCP lease compulsarily which is initially provided by the libvirt network
# cloud-init configuration then replaces the network with a static IP
#
# NOTE: The entire VM infrastructure creation is driven using the role cloud-init
